This is a listing of some of the plugins HcRaid used when it was open.
Some people were trying to make financial gains selling the binaries. Here is the source!

If you were planning on spending real money on these, please consider using some of that money towards an animal charity such as Dogs Trust, RSPCA or Blue Cross.
If you are American, don't be stupid and donate it to someone like PETA.

Any plugins I've missed or further info is needed please create an issue.

Many thanks,
